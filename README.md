Graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. Recently completed a Full Stack Web Application Development course of study that lasted eight months. The course of study led to my employment with Revature.

I grew up neither rich nor poor and although we didn't have everything some people had, we didn't lack for the necessities and even took yearly family vacations to go camping and such.  My dad was career Navy but managed to put seven children through Catholic school.  So, I grew up with neither the expectation that anything would be given to me nor the expectation that anything was due me (aside of course from the freedom to pursue the career ambitions I chose and to make the most of the opportunities that my hard work, resulting skills, and talent qualified me for).  I think over the long haul my upbringing instilled a sense that nothing is guaranteed and that you have to go out into the world and make your way; further, a sense that we are all entitled to the prosperity and opportunity that my country has afforded, given of course, the constraints mentioned above.

Throughout my career I worked on and helped resolve various power system related issues that relied on a combination of laborious analysis, technical knowledge from my university degree, and occasionally an insight or deeper thought to shine the way to resolution of the system issue.  Pursuing Web Application development seemed a way to leverage those "soft skills" into another decade of interesting, stimulating, and perhaps rewarding career life.

Although I used to prefer fishing and camping and even fantasy football, I've taken a track of catching up on newer Star Trek productions and exploring the city I live in.  Covid 19 put a damper on one of those things but I'm optimistic about the future.
